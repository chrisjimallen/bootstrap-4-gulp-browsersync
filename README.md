# Bootstrap 4 build with Browsersync & Gulp

## How to use

* Clone this repository
* `cd` into directory
* `npm install && gulp`

This will serve your template up on http://localhost:3000. Any changes to the JS or HTML will cause the browsersync to reload. All Scss changes will be injected without reload.

More detailed instructions to follow, I just wanted to get this up & live.
